## Disclaimer

The patterns shown in this repository are meant for educational purposes.  While this is sufficiently secure to use for personal projects, there are considerations not mentioned in this tutorial series that should be explored for an enterprise-grade implementation.

In other words, this will get you 95% of the way there, but do you own research to ensure your implementation is secure!

## How to use this Repo

This repo has two branches:

* master
* final

The `master` branch has a starter template for creating what is in the `final` branch.

There is an Angular app included, but is entirely optional.  Since JWT authentication is commonly seen in SPAs (single page applications) like Angular, I decided it was important to at least have a basic implementation.

## How to run the app

When you go to each branch, the `README.md` will show you how to start the app.

The `master` branch is incomplete and you can follow the written or video tutorials to complete:
